= Fingerprint

A fingerprinting and similarity module for go.

This is an implementation of algorithm described in the http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~mac/ENS/DOC/sigmod03-1.pdf[Winnowing: Local Algorithms for Document Fingerprinting] and can be used to fingerprint document text and calculate a similarity score using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index[Jaccard index or similarity coefficient]

The library is intended to be used for relatively small documents and not designed for use with streams or channels.
