= Fingerprint

A fingerprinting and similarity module for go.

This is an implementation of algorithm described in the http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~mac/ENS/DOC/sigmod03-1.pdf[Winnowing: Local Algorithms for Document Fingerprinting] and can be used to fingerprint document text and calculate a similarity score using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index[Jaccard index or similarity coefficient]

The library works for  relatively small documents and not designed for use with streams or channels.

[source,go]
----
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/grahambrooks/fingerprint/fingerprinter"
	"github.com/grahambrooks/fingerprint/similarity"
)

func main() {
	score := similarity.StringSimilarity("the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", fingerprinter.Options{})

	fmt.Printf("Similary score %f", score)
}

Produces:

> go run main.go
Similary score 1.000000
----

The similarity score is between 0 (dissimilar) to 1 similar depending on the fingerrpint options.
